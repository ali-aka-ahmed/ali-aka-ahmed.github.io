# Project Overview

## Current Iteration: Minimalist Design

The project is currently in a minimalist iteration, focusing on simplicity and user focus. This approach ensures that the core functionalities are presented in a straightforward and accessible manner, without any unnecessary complications or distractions.

## Next Steps: Performance and Readability Improvements

To enhance the project's performance and readability, the following steps are planned:
- **Code Refactoring:** Streamlining the existing codebase to improve efficiency and maintainability.
- **UI Enhancements:** Updating the user interface to make it more intuitive and easier to navigate, which will contribute to a better overall user experience.

## Future Enhancements: Graphics

As coding with GPT becomes more accessible and easier, we envision incorporating more interactive and visually appealing graphics into the project. This will not only enhance the aesthetic appeal but also make the project more engaging for users.

By continuously improving and evolving, we aim to make the project more performant, readable, and visually appealing in the future.
